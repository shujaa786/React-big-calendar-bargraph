# React Big Calendar with Bar Graph


A sample React + Redux project demonstrating:


- Integration with **react-big-calendar** (date, week, month views).
- Date-wise dummy data loaded from a JSON file.
- Highlighting selected date in the calendar.
- Clicking a highlighted date opens a popup with a **bar graph** for that date (using **recharts**).
- If there is no data, a warning message is shown.
- Cross-platform (Windows/macOS/Linux) instructions provided.
